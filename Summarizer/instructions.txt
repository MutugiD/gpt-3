Dear Madam,   
RE: RECOVERY OF SUMS OWED TO PATA-PESA CREDIT LIMITED (hereinafter “the Company”) BY MWINYI PETERSON KIPAJI (hereinafter “the borrower”)
The subject matter refers.   
We advanced a loan facility to the tune of Tanzanian Shillings Two Hundred and Seventy Thousand (TZ270000/=) and an insurance premium financing (IPF) of Kshs 32642/= to one, MWINYI PETERSON KIPAJI (“the borrower”) on 16th November 2019 and 10th June 2020 respectively after confirming all the documents for application and collateral being, a Grey Station Wagon Vanette, TZU445 were in order. 
The loan was to be re-paid in Eighteen (18) monthly instalments of TZ 22127/- from 10th January 2020, to 6nd of November 2021. The borrower paid a few installments. Thereafter, the borrower failed to pay any of the remaining instalments as and when they fell due. This caused the loan to fall into arrears and as per our collection process, the collateral was due for repossession which we undertook via our auctioneers – Xpress Auctioneers.
The motor vehicle (TZU445) was valued, and tracking devices were installed as evidenced by the tracking certificate and valuation report enclosed herewith.      
The loan was to be re-paid in Eighteen (18) monthly instalments of TZ 22127/from 4th January 2021, to 2nd of June 2022. The borrower paid a few installments. Thereafter, the borrower failed to pay any of the remaining instalments as and when they fell due. This caused the loan to fall into arrears and as per our collection process, the collateral was due for repossession which we undertook via our auctioneers – Xpress Auctioneers.    
Upon repossession, the loan was in arrears to the tune of TZ 386937/=. The Company sent a disposition notice to the borrower stating its intention to sell the motor vehicle via public auction as empowered by the Movable Property Security Rights Act, 2020 and other laws. In an aim to recover our loan amount and other fees therefrom, the Company conducted a pre-disposal valuation on the collateral, advertised the collateral in the local dailies and exercised its statutory right of sale by disposing the motor vehicle on or around 5th October, 2020 for an amount of TZ 210000/=    
However, this did not fully offset our owed amount. This necessitates that we institute a debt recovery process to enable us to recover the balance that is TZ 164967/=.       
Our instructions to you therefore are to institute instant recovery proceedings in the Small Claims Court against the client for the total amount owed to us that is TZ 146867/=.       
Allow us to send the borrower’s pre-disposition valuation report in due time.    Keep us updated on any progress and ensure our interests are protected at all times.   
Kindly acknowledge receipt of these documents by signing and returning a copy of this letter.    
Yours faithfully,   
For: Pata-Pesa Credit Limited
