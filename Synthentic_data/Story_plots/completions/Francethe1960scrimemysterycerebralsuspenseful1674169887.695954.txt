The film opens in Paris in the 1960s. We are introduced to the main character, a private detective named Jacques Renard. Jacques is contacted by a wealthy businessman, who wants him to investigate the death of his son. The businessman's son was found dead in a hotel room, and the police have ruled it a suicide. The businessman does not believe that his son would have taken his own life, and he wants Jacques to find out what really happened.

Jacques begins his investigation by talking to the son's friends and acquaintances. He quickly learns that the son was involved in a shady business deal, and that he had been receiving threatening phone calls. Jacques also learns that the son was seeing a woman who was not his wife.

As Jacques delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the son's death was no suicide. He was murdered, and the killer staged the scene to make it look like a suicide. Jacques discovers that the killer is the woman the son was seeing. She killed him because she was afraid he was going to leave her.

Jacques confronts the woman and she confesses to the murder. The film ends with Jacques bringing the killer to justice.
