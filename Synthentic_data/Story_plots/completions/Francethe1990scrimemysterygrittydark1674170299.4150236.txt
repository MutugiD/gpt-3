The film opens with a close-up of a handgun being cocked. A voiceover narrates: "France, 1990. The Cold War is over, but the world is still a dangerous place."

The camera pulls back to reveal a man in a dark suit and tie, holding the gun. He is in a seedy apartment, and there is a body on the floor. The man, we will learn, is a private investigator named Jacques Bordeaux.

Jacques has been hired by a woman named Simone to find her missing husband, Andre. Andre is a political activist who has gotten involved with a group called the Red Brigade. The Red Brigade is a radical leftist organization that is planning to overthrow the government.

Andre has been missing for weeks, and Simone is frantic. Jacques agrees to take the case and starts by tracking down Andre's last known associate, a man named Rene. Rene is also a member of the Red Brigade, and he tells Jacques that Andre has gone underground and is hiding out in Paris.

Jacques starts to search for Andre, but the closer he gets, the more he realizes that Andre is in over his head. The Red Brigade is a dangerous group, and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals.

As Jacques gets closer to finding Andre, the stakes get higher. He is put in danger by the Red Brigade, and he knows that if he can find Andre, he can save him from a fate worse than death.

The film climaxes with a tense showdown between Jacques and the Red Brigade. Jacques is outnumbered and outgunned, but he is determined to save Andre. In the end, he is successful, and the film ends with Jacques and Andre walking away from the Red Brigade's safe house, alive but changed by the experience.
