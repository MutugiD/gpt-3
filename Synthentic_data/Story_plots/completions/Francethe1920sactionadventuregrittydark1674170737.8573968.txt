In the early 1920s, France is in a state of upheaval. The country is weak and corrupt, and the people are tired of being ruled by a monarchy. A group of revolutionaries, led by a charismatic young man named Jean-Paul Marat, decide to take matters into their own hands and overthrow the government.

As the revolution begins, Marat and his followers quickly gain control of the capital city, Paris. They establish a new government, with Marat as its leader. However, the other parts of the country do not acquiesce to the new regime so easily. The revolutionaries are met with fierce resistance from the Royalist forces, who are determined to crush the rebellion and restore the monarchy.

After months of bloody battles and suffering heavy losses, the revolutionaries are finally victorious. Marat is hailed as a hero, and the people of France rejoice in their newfound freedom. However, the peace is short-lived. In the years that follow, Marat and his government become increasingly tyrannical, and the people realize that they are not that much better off than they were before. As discontent grows, another revolution begins to brew.
