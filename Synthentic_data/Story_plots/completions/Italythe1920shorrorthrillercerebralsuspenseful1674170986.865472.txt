In the 1920s, Italy is a hotbed of political unrest. The country is in the midst of a civil war, and the ruling party is losing its grip on power. In the midst of this turmoil, a group of scientists are conducting experiments in a remote research facility in the Italian countryside. These experiments involve using a device that can induce a state of suspended animation in human subjects.

The scientists are not the only ones interested in this technology. A ruthless criminal syndicate known as the Black Hand is also interested in the device, and they will stop at nothing to get their hands on it.

The scientists are kidnapped by the Black Hand, and their research facility is destroyed. They are taken to a secret black site where they are forced to continue their work for the syndicate.

The scientists manage to perfect the device, and the Black Hand begins using it to create an army of super-soldiers. These soldiers are sent on mission to destabilize the government and bring the syndicate to power.

The soldiers are highly effective, and the syndicate's power grows. The country descends into chaos, and the civil war erupts into a full-scale revolution.

The scientists are horrified by what they have helped to create, and they refuse to continue working for the Black Hand. The syndicate responds by killiing the scientists' families. The scientists have no choice but to continue their work.

The device is finally perfected, and the Black Hand is able to create an army of invincible soldiers. With this army, they march on Rome and take control of the country.

The country is plunged into a dark age, and the people live in fear of the Black Hand's army of super-soldiers.
