COVERSATION OVER HEARD

While having dinner at a restaurant, two government officials discuss a recent murder. One official is certain that the victim, a high-ranking member of the Communist Party, was killed by rivals within the Party. The other official is not so sure, and thinks that the real culprit may be someone outside of the Party altogether.

THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS

The case is assigned to Detective Li Wei, a no-nonsense officer who is known for his deductive skills. Li begins by re-interviewing the victim's family and colleagues. He quickly learns that the victim had been receiving death threats, and that he had been involved in a number of controversies within the Party.

Li also uncovers a possible link between the victim and a powerful gangster, who is rumored to have ties to the criminal underground.

THE SUSPECTS

As Li digs deeper into the case, he develops a list of suspects, all of whom have something to gain from the victim's death. The list includes the victim's rivals within the Party, the gangster with ties to the criminal underground, and even the victim's own family members.

THE CLIMAX

Li narrows down the list of suspects and eventually identifies the killer. The killer is brought to justice, and the case is closed.
