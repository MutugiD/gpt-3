Radhika is horrified. She knows that this murder is part of the growing sectarian violence in the country. And she knows that she could be the next target.

With her life in danger, Radhika must use all her cunning and resourcefulness to survive. She must outwit her pursuers and find a way to escape the city alive.

The clock is ticking. The body count is rising. And the stakes could not be higher. This is a heart-stopping thriller set against the backdrop of India's dark and turbulent recent history.
