The film opens in Rome in 1965. Maria, a young woman in her twenties, is on her way to meet her boyfriend, Giovanni, for a date. She's running a little late, and as she hurries through the streets, she notices a dark figure following her. She quickens her pace, but the figure keeps pace with her. She turns a corner into an alley, and the figure grabs her from behind. She screams, but he covers her mouth with his hand and drags her into the shadows.

He pushes her up against a wall and pulls out a knife, holding it to her throat. She's terrified, and her eyes fill with tears. The man hisses at her in Italian, "If you make a sound, I'll kill you."

 Maria is shaking, but she manages to nod her head slightly. The man slowly lowers the knife and begins to unbutton her blouse. She's frozen in fear, and she can do nothing but watch as he rapes her.

When he's finished, he tells her that if she tells anyone about what happened, he'll kill her and her family. Then he vanishes into the night, leaving her sobbing in the alley.

 Maria is too afraid to go to the police, so she tells Giovanni what happened. He's furious, and he wants to go to the cops himself, but Maria begs him not to. She's afraid that the man will make good on his threat and kill her and her family.

Giovanni does some digging, and he finds out that the man who raped Maria is a member of the Mafia. He's a dangerous man, and if they go to the police, he could come after them.

Giovanni comes up with a plan to get revenge. He tells Maria to pretend that nothing happened, and he starts to make friends with the Mafia man. He gains his trust, and then he invites him over to his apartment one night. When the man arrives, Giovanni kills him with a knife.

 Maria is relieved, but she's also traumatized by the experience. Giovanni tries to comfort her, but she's scarred for life. The film ends with them moving away from Rome, trying to start a new life together.
