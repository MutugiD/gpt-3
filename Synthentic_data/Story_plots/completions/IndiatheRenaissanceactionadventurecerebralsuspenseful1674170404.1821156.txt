In the late 1500s, India is in the midst of a golden age. The Mogul Empire is at the height of its power, and the country is prospering. One of the main reasons for this is the discovery of a new metal, cinnabar. Cinnabar is used to make a red pigment that is used in paintings and sculptures, and is in high demand by the wealthy.

Ishan, a young cinnabar miner, is working in the mines when he discovers a vein of the rarest and most valuable metal in the world: orichalcum. He knows that if he tells the authorities, he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams. But he also knows that the Mogul Emperor, Akbar, is a ruthless ruler who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the new metal.

Ishan decides to keep his discovery a secret and sets out to find a buyer who will pay him a fair price. He soon discovers that there are others who are also interested in the orichalcum, and he must race against time to find a buyer before they do.

The story is full of suspense, action, and adventure, as Ishan tries to outwit the other orichalcum hunters while also evading the clutches of the emperor. In the end, he manages to sell the metal and make a fortune, but only just barely escapes with his life.
