The film opens with a group of French peasants in the early 1500s. They are living in poverty and struggling to make ends meet. One day, a strange man arrives in the village and offers them a deal. If they agree to work for him, he will pay them a fortune. The peasants agree and the man leads them into the forest outside the village.

Once in the forest, the man reveals himself to be a powerful sorcerer. He tells the peasants that he needs their help to perform a ritual that will summon a demon. The sorcerer believes that the demon will grant him immense power and wealth. The peasants are hesitant, but the sorcerer promises them that they will be rich beyond their wildest dreams if they help him.

The sorcerer begins the ritual, and as he calls forth the demon, a storm erupts and lightning strikes the ground around the peasants. The demon appears and kills the sorcerer, but instead of granting the peasants their wishes, the demon begins to terrorize the village.

The demon is a brutal and merciless killer, and it takes pleasure in torturing and murdering the villagers. The villagers are defenseless against the demon, and it seems like all is lost. However, one of the villagers, a young woman named Sarah, has been studying witchcraft and has been able to learn some protective spells.

Sarah uses her magic to defend the villagers from the demon, but she is outnumbered and outmatched. The demon is about to kill Sarah when she suddenly remembers a powerful spell that can banish the demon back to the underworld. She uses the spell and the demon is sucked back into the underworld, never to be seen again.

The villagers are relieved and grateful to Sarah for saving them. She is hailed as a hero, and the village prospers.
