The film opens with a scene of a busy street in Rome, Italy. People are going about their day and there is a sense of urgency in the air. We see a car pull up to the curb and a young woman, Maria, steps out. She is in a hurry and does not notice the man who is following her. 

 Maria makes her way through the streets, unaware that she is being followed. We see her enter a building and the man following her close behind. Maria goes to the roof of the building, where she is met by her boyfriend, Enzo. The two embrace and share a kiss. 

It is clear that Maria is distraught and Enzo is trying to comfort her. She tells him that she is pregnant and does not know what to do. Enzo tells her that he will take care of everything and that she does not need to worry. 

The couple is unaware that the man who followed Maria is still watching them from the street. He is a hitman who has been hired by Maria's father to kill her. 

Enzo and Maria make their way back to Maria's apartment, where they discuss their options. Maria is adamant that she does not want to have an abortion, but Enzo is not sure what else they can do. He suggests that they elope and get married, but Maria is hesitant. 

The hitman breaks into Maria's apartment and attempts to kill her. Enzo pushes her out of the way and is shot instead. Maria runs to his aid, but it is too late. Enzo dies in her arms. 

The hitman flees the scene and Maria is left devastated. She sinks to the floor, cradling Enzo's lifeless body in her arms. 

The film ends with a montage of Maria's life. We see her getting married and having a child. We see her living her life, but always with the pain of losing Enzo.
