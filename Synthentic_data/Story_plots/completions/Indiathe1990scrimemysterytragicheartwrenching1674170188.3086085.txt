In the 1990s, India is a country in turmoil. Political and religious tensions are high, and crime is rampant. Into this volatile mix comes a young woman, Aarzoo, who has just lost her husband in a tragic accident. Aarzoo is desperate to find out what happened to her husband, and she turns to a local private investigator, Rakesh, for help.

Rakesh is a tough, no-nonsense PI, and he quickly realizes that there is more to this case than meets the eye. He begins to uncover a web of conspiracy and corruption that leads all the way to the top of the Indian government. As he gets closer and closer to the truth, Rakesh realizes that he is also in danger of becoming a target.

Despite the danger, Rakesh is determined to find out what happened to Aarzoo's husband, and to justice. He leads Aarzoo on a dangerous chase across India, from the seedy underworld of Bombay to the treacherous mountains of the north. Along the way, they will face evasion, violence, and betrayal, but Rakesh is determined to get to the bottom of the case, no matter what the consequences.
