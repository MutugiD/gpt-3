Italian lace tycoon, Sergio Albinati, is on the brink of ruin. His flagship store in Milan has been losing money for years and Sergio is desperate to find a way to turn things around. He's heard rumours of a lost city deep in the Amazon jungle that's rumoured to be full of priceless treasures. Sergio knows that if he can find this city, he can save his business and become a rich man.

Sergio hires an experienced guide, Marco, to take him into the jungle. Marco is not convinced that the city exists, but he needs the money and so he agrees to take Sergio into the heart of the Amazon. For weeks, they search for the city, but they find nothing. Marco starts to lose hope, but Sergio is adamant that the city exists.

One night, they make camp in a clearing and Marco finally snaps. He tells Sergio that he's been leading him on a wild goose chase and that there is no city. Sergio doesn't believe him and so Marco tells him the story of El Dorado, the lost city of gold.

 Marco says that El Dorado is a myth, a story that's been passed down through the generations. It's said that the city is made entirely of gold and that it's hidden deep in the jungle. Marco says that he's been leading Sergio in circles and that there is no city to find.

Sergio is heartbroken, but he knows that Marco is right. He's wasted months, and he's lost all hope of finding the city. He's about to give up when he hears a noise in the distance. He follows the noise until he comes to a clearing and there, in front of him, is the lost city of El Dorado.
