His First Love 

Lin Xiang is a young man living in China during the 1920s. He's in love with a girl named Ying, but she is betrothed to another man. Lin decides to leave his small village and travel to the big city in order to make a better life for himself - and perhaps win Ying's heart. 

In the city, Lin befriends a man named Zhao who introduces him to the criminal underworld. Lin quickly learns that Zhao is a ruthless gangster, but he also becomes mesmerized by the excitement and power that comes with the life of crime. 

While working for Zhao, Lin meets a beautiful singer named Jade at one of the gang's nightclubs. He falls in love with her, and they begin a secret affair. 

Meanwhile, Ying arrives in the city with her husband. She and Lin meet by chance, and the old feelings between them quickly resurface. Ying is unhappy in her marriage, and she and Lin begin to plot a way to be together. 

As Lin becomes more and more involved with Zhao's gang, he starts to lose sight of his original goals. He becomes caught up in the violence and greed, and he starts to distance himself from Ying and Jade. 

One night, Zhao asks Lin to help him with a big heist. Lin knows that it will be dangerous, but he agrees to do it. The heist goes wrong, and Lin is seriously injured. He's taken to the hospital, where he slips into a coma. 

As Lin lies in the hospital, his friends and loved ones - Ying, Jade, and Zhao - all visit him. They each reflect on their time with Lin, and they all come to realize that they miss the old Lin - the kind, gentle man who they all fell in love with. 

Lin recovers from his coma, and he realizes that he needs to make some changes in his life. He breaks up with Jade, and he reconciliation with Ying. The two of them leave the city and return to Lin's village, where they get married and live happily ever after.
