In the 1920s, China is a country in turmoil. The ruling Qing Dynasty is on its last legs, and a civil war is raging between the nationalists and the communists. Into this maelstrom comes a young woman, Li Mei.

Li Mei is the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and she has been sheltered her entire life. But when her father is killed by a bandit, she is thrust into the world on her own. She is soon taken in by a kind-hearted man named Chen, who teaches her how to fight and survive in this dangerous time.

Li Mei quickly becomes one of the most skilled fighters in China, and she soon catches the eye of the leader of the nationalist army, GeneralSun Yat-sen. He recruits her into his army, and she quickly proves herself to be a valuable asset.

The nationalists are pitted against the communists in a bloody civil war, and Li Mei finds herself in the thick of the fighting. She quickly becomes known as the "Red Eagle" for her skill in battle.

The war takes a toll on both sides, and soon the entire country is a battlefield. In a brutal battle, Li Mei is seriously injured and Chen is killed. This tragedy only hardens her resolve to win the war.

After years of fighting, the war comes to an end, with the nationalists victorious. Li Mei is hailed as a hero, and she returns to her home city. But she is haunted by the memories of the war, and she knows that the peace is only temporary.
