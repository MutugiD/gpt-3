Renaissance Italy is a beautiful and peaceful place...until strange things begin happening in the small town of San Gimignano. People start disappearing in the night, strange shadows are seen lurking in the streets, and there is a sense of unease among the townsfolk. The Mayor calls on the famous scholar and investigator, Niccolo Machiavelli, to help solve the mystery.

Machiavelli begins his investigation by interviewing the townsfolk and piecing together what they have seen. He quickly realizes that there is a supernatural force at work in San Gimignano. He also finds out that the town has a dark history - many years ago, a coven of witches tried to take over the town but were ultimately defeated. Could the witches be back and looking for revenge?

As Machiavelli delves deeper into the mystery, he comes face to face with the witches. They reveal that they have been resurrected and are planning to sacrifice the townspeople in a blood ritual in order to gain power. Machiavelli must find a way to stop the witches before they can sacrifice the entire town...
