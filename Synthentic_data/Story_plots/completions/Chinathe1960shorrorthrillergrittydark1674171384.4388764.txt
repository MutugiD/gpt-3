China, 1960s. After years of civil war, the Communist Party has finally secured control of the country. To consolidate their power, the Party launches a massive campaign to root out all "counterrevolutionary elements." Thousands are arrested and sent to prison camps, where they are tortured and forced to confess to their "crimes."

Among those caught up in the purge is Wen, a young woman from a wealthy family. She is arrested and sent to a prison camp in the remote Gobi Desert. There, she is tortured and interrogated by the sadistic camp commander, who is determined to break her.

Wen is eventually broken and confesses to her "crimes." She is sentenced to death and taken to the execution grounds. Just as she is about to be killed, she is rescued by a group of rebels. She joins the rebels and quickly becomes one of their most effective soldiers.

The rebels are fighting against both the Communist Party and the Imperial Japanese Army, who are trying to reassert control over China. The war is brutal, and the rebels are constantly on the run. But they continue to fight, inspired by their belief in a better future.

One day, the rebels are ambushed by the Communist Army. Wen is captured and taken back to the prison camp. There, she is once again tortured by the camp commander. But this time, she does not break.

The film ends with Wen's execution. As she is being killed, she thinks of her fellow rebels and their fight for a better future.
