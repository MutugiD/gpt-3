One day, she tells Pierre of her desire to travel and he suggests that they move to Paris. Lila is hesitant at first, but she eventually agrees.

They pack up their belongings and move to the city. Lila is mesmerized by the sights and sounds of Paris. She quickly assimilates into city life and begins working as a waitress in a cafe. Pierre finds work as a cab driver. They are both happy with their new lives.

Pierre, meanwhile, is struggling to adjust to life without Lila. He tries dating other women, but he can't seem to forget about her. He becomes depressed and starts drinking heavily.

One day, Lila receives a call from Pierre. He tells her that he is having a breakdown and needs her help. She agrees to come over and check on him. When she arrives, she finds him intoxicated and crying on the floor. She comforts him and they end up making love.

Afterwards, Lila tells Pierre that she still loves him and wants to try to make things work. Philippe overhears the conversation and demands that Lila choose between him and Pierre. Lila hesitates, but ultimately chooses Pierre. She breaks off her affair with Philippe and reconciles with her husband.
