Doors slam shut, a match scratches against a box, and suddenly a dark figure is illuminated in a smoke-filled room. It's 1960s France, and things are about to get gritty.

 commodities trader Maurice Renard is in his element. He's just closed a deal that will make him a very wealthy man. But there's a catch: the deal was done using inside information that he acquired illegally. 

Maurice knows that it's only a matter of time before the authorities catch up to him. He needs to get out of the country, and fast. But first, he's going to have to get his hands on some cash. 

Maurice hatches a daring plan to rob the Commodities Exchange, where he knows the security codes. He enliststhe help of a group of criminals, and they successfully pull off the heist. 

But things quickly go sour. One of the thieves is killed, and the rest of the group is captured by the police. Maurice is the only one who manages to escape. 

Now a fugitive, Maurice makes his way to the airport, where he hopes to board a plane to Brazil. But he's intercepted by the police and taken into custody. 

Maurice is sentenced to life in prison, where he spends the rest of his days. But he never stops scheming, and he never gives up hope ofescape. Finally, after years of planning, he makes his move. 

Maurice escaped from prison and made his way to Brazil, where he lived out the rest of his days in hiding. But the memory of his crimes-and his victims-never left him.
