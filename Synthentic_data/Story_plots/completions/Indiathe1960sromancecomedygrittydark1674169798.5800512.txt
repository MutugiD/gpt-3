In the early 1960s, India is a country on the brink of change. The caste system is still in place, and the country is plagued by poverty and political unrest. Despite all of this, there is a sense of hope in the air.

A young woman named Jyoti is a member of the lower caste, and she has been in love with a man named Amar since they were children. Amar is from a higher caste, and their love is forbidden. Jyoti's family is devastated when she is forced to marry a man she does not love, but they do not want to risk losing their daughter entirely.

Amar is consumed by grief when Jyoti is married off, and he quickly falls into a life of alcoholism and despair. His friends and family try to help him, but nothing seems to reach him.

One day, Amar decides to end his life by jumping off a bridge into the river below. Jyoti sees him jump and rushes to save him. She manages to pull him out of the water and revive him.

Amar is shocked to see Jyoti after all these years, and the two of them quickly realize that they are still madly in love with each other. They begin to secretly meet and rekindle their relationship.

Jyoti's husband quickly becomes suspicious of her behavior, and he hires a detective to tail her. Jyoti and Amar are caught in the act, and they are forced to go on the run.

As they travel across India, they experience the country's beauty and its harsh realities. They encounter poverty, violence, and death, but they also find moments of love and tenderness.

Ultimately, they are caught by Jyoti's husband and his men. Amar is killed, and Jyoti is forced to watch as her husband triumphantly burns her in her own funeral pyre.
