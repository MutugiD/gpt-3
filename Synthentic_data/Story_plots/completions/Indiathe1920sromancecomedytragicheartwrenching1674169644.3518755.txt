In the 1920s, India is a land of great contrasts, with the British ruling over a largely impoverished population. Among the British are a small number of wealthy aristocrats, including Lady Cassandra, who lives in a great estate with her son, Lord Lionel. Lionel is handsome and charming, and he soon catches the eye of young Indian woman, Raja.

Raja is the daughter of a wealthy Indian Raja, and she is immediately drawn to Lionel. The two begin a passionate affair, much to the disapproval of their respective families. However, they are determined to be together and they elope.

They are happy together for a time, but eventually the realities of their different backgrounds begin to take their toll. Lionel is used to a life of luxury, while Raja is more accustomed to a simple lifestyle. Raja takes Lionel to meet her family, but he is appalled by their poverty and he soon withdraws from her.

Raja is heartbroken, but she is soon consoled by her childhood friend, Dev. Dev has always loved Raja, and now he seizes his opportunity to win her heart. The two begin a new relationship, much to Lionel's jealousy.

Lionel tries to win Raja back, but she is now in love with Dev and she rejects him. This only makes Lionel more determined to win her back, and he begins to scheme. He finds out that Dev is going to inherit a large sum of money, and he convinces Lady Cassandra to help him steal it. Together, they dupe Dev out of his money and leave him penniless.

Raja is devastated when she finds out what Lionel has done. She confronts him, but he is unapologetic and he tells her that he will never let her go. Raja is now trapped in a loveless marriage with a man she hates. However, she is still determined to find happiness, and she eventually finds it with Dev, who has forgiven her for her part in his ruin. The two are finally able to be together and they live happily ever after.
