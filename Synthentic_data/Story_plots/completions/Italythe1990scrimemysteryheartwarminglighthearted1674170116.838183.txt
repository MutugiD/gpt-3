In the early 1990s, a group of criminals in Italy began committing a series of art heists. They targets famous museums and galleries, sometimes stealing entire collections. The police are baffled by the thefts and can't seem to find any clues.

One day, a young woman named Sofia is visiting a museum in Florence with her parents when she notices a man acting suspiciously. She follows him and sees him commit a robbery. She reports this to the police and they begin investigating.

Sofia becomes interested in the case and starts doing her own research. She discovers that the man she saw is part of a group of thieves who have been stealing from museums all over Italy. She also finds out that they have a specific target in mind: the art collection of a wealthy businessman named Alberto Moretti.

Sofia goes to Moretti's estate and warns him about the thieves. He doesn't believe her at first, but she is eventually able to convince him. Moretti decides to hire her as his personal assistant.

The thieves soon discover that Sofia is onto them. They kidnap her and Moretti and demand a ransom of $10 million. Moretti agrees to pay the ransom, but the thieves double-cross him and steal the money.

Sofia and Moretti are able to escape and they call the police. The thieves are eventually caught and the art is returned to its rightful owners.

Sofia and Moretti fall in love during the course of the investigation and they get married. They move to Moretti's estate and live happily ever after.
