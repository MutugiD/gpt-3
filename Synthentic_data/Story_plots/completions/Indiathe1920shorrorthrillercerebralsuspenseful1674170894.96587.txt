The film opens in 1920s India, where a young woman named Leela is living with her husband and young son. Leela is pregnant with her second child, and she is desperate to find a way to support her family. She takes a job as a maid at a local hotel, but she quickly realizes that the hotel is a front for a prostitution ring. Leela is horrified by the things she sees at the hotel, but she knows she can't leave because she needs the money to support her family.

One night, Leela is working at the hotel when a group of men comes in and asks for a room. The men are very drunk and leering, and Leela is terrified of them. She shows them to a room and then goes to get the hotel owner, Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh is a cruel man who runs the hotel like a prison. He tells Leela to stay in the room with the men and make sure they don't leave.

Leela is terrified, but she does as she's ordered. The men start to undress her, but before they can rape her, they suddenly fall asleep. Leela is relieved, but she's also curious about what happened. She decides to take a look at the men, and she realizes that they're all dead. She starts to panic, but she's quickly caught by Mr. Singh.

Mr. Singh accuses Leela of killing the men, but she insists that she didn't do anything. Mr. Singh doesn't believe her, and he decides to punishments her by locking her in a room with the dead bodies. Leela is horrified, and she starts to believe that she's going insane. She starts to hallucinate, and she sees the dead men coming for her. She screams and pounds on the door, but no one comes to help her.

Leela is eventually found by a maid who hears her screaming. The maid releases her, and Leela runs out of the hotel in terror. She's found by her husband, who takes her home. Leela is traumatized by her experience, and she starts to believe that the ghosts of the dead men are coming to get her. She starts to see them everywhere she goes, and she becomes a paranoid wreck.

The film ends with Leela's husband finding her dead in their house. It's implied that she's killed herself, and the film ends with her husband crying over her body.
