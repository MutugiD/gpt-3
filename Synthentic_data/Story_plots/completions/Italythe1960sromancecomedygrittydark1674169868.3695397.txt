It is the 1960s in Italy. Our story begins with two young lovers, Franco and Rosa, who are from opposite sides of the tracks. Franco is a rebellious young man from a poor, working-class background, while Rosa is the daughter of a wealthy, conservative politician.

The two young lovers meet one fateful night at a dance and they instantly fall in love with each other, much to the disapproval of Rosa's father. Franco is determined to win over Rosa's father and he comes up with a plan to do so.

He hatches a scheme to kidnap Rosa's father and demand a ransom for his safe return. However, the plan quickly goes awry and Franco and Rosa find themselves on the run from the law.

As they are fleeing from the authorities, they come across a secluded farmhouse in the countryside. They take refuge in the farmhouse and the owners, an elderly couple, take them in.

As the days go by, Franco and Rosa begin to develop feelings for each other. However, their happiness is short-lived as the police finally catch up to them.

 Franco and Rosa are arrested and put on trial. During the trial, Franco's true love for Rosa is revealed and her father finally comes to accept him.

The two young lovers are sentenced to prison, but they are eventually pardoned and released. They return to the farmhouse where they are finally able to live happily ever after.
