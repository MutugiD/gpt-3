In the gritty, dark underworld of China in the 1990s, a criminal mastermind known only as the Dragon is pulling the strings of the country's most powerful crime families. From his hidden lair, the Dragon controls the flow of drugs, weapons, and information, making him the most feared player in the criminal underworld.

The Dragon's latest scheme is a new form of methamphetamine that is much more powerful and addictive than anything on the market. This new drug, known as "the Dragon's Breath," quickly becomes the most popular drug in China, and the Dragon is raking in billions of dollars in profits.

However, there is one man who is not afraid of the Dragon: Detective Li Wei of the Shanghai Police Department. Li Wei is a relentless cop who has dedicated his life to taking down the city's criminal underworld. When the Dragon's Breath hits the streets, Li Wei is determined to put an end to the Dragon's reign of terror.

Li Wei's investigation leads him to the Dragon's hidden lair. In a final showdown, Li Wei confronts the Dragon, and a fierce battle ensues. In the end, Li Wei emerges victorious, and the Dragon is finally brought to justice.
