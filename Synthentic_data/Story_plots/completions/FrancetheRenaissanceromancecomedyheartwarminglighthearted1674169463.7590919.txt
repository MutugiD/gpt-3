She hatches a plan to meet him by disguising herself as a noblewoman. Catherine's scheme is successful and the two eventually marry.

However, not long after they are wed, Henri is called away to fight in a war. Catherine is left behind in France, where she must contend with court politics and the jealousy of Henri's mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Diane is determined to sabotage Catherine's relationship with Henri and undermine her position at court.

Catherine is further isolated when she learns that she is unable to have children. Henri returns from the war and is devastated by the news. Catherine is heartbroken but remains determined to find a way to win back her husband's love.

With the help of her ladies-in-waiting, Catherine comes up with a plan to outwit Diane and finally win Henri's heart. They host a lavish masquerade ball, during which Catherine wears a mask that makes her look like Diane. Henri is fooled by the disguise and is drawn to Catherine.

The plan works and Diane is finally out of the picture. Catherine and Henri are able to renew their love for each other and live happily ever after.
