Raman and Leela are two young lovers in India during the 1990s. They come from different backgrounds and have different views on life, but they are drawn together by their mutual love and respect for each other.

Raman is a Hindu, and comes from a wealthy family. His parents are arranged to have him marry a woman from a similar background, but Raman is not interested in her. He wants to marry Leela, a Muslim woman from a poorer background.

Leela is also not interested in an arranged marriage. She wants to marry Raman, but her parents will not allow it. They do not approve of him because he is Hindu, and they do not want their daughter to marry outside of their faith.

Raman and Leela are determined to be together, and they come up with a plan. Leela will pretend to be Raman's sister, and they will live together as brother and sister until they can get married.

They carry out their plan, and it works for a while. But eventually, the inevitable happens and their parents find out. They are not happy about it, but they come to accept it and give their blessing.

Raman and Leela get married and live happily ever after.
