In the 1920s, China is a country in turmoil. Despite this, there is still a sense of hope and possibility in the air. One group of people who embody this hope are a group of young artists who are trying to create a new form of art that will express the Chinese experience in a fresh and innovative way.

One of these artists is a young woman named Mei-ling. Mei-ling is a painter who is deeply inspired by the world around her. She is in love with a man named Xiao, who is also an artist. The two of them share a deep bond and understand each other in a way that no one else does.

However, their relationship is put to the test when Xiao is recruited by the Communist party to go to Moscow to study. Mei-ling is heartbroken, but she knows that it is for the best. She supports his decision and the two of them parted ways.

Mei-ling continues to paint and is eventually able to sell some of her work. She is also able to find a teaching job. As the years go by, she never forgets Xiao and the love they shared.

One day, out of the blue, Xiao comes back into her life. He has been studying in Moscow and has now been sent back to China. The two of them are overjoyed to be reunited and pick up right where they left off.

They get married and have a beautiful life together. Their love for each other is stronger than ever and they are finally able to pursue their art without interruption.

The film ends with a montage of scenes from Mei-ling and Xiao's life together, set to a song about everlasting love.
