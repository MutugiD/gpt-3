In the 1920s, France is a broken country, reeling from the devastation of the Great War. The people are searching for anything that can bring them joy, and for many, that comes in the form of alcohol, gambling, and parties. In the midst of this hedonism is a group of friends who are searching for something more.

The group is made up of two women and three men, all in their twenties. They are all artists in some way, and they all have a deep love for France. They spend their days and nights exploring the city, going to parties, and talking about art and life.

One night, they stumble upon a mysterious underground club. The club is run by a woman named Giselle, who is a former dancer. Giselle and her club are a haven for artists, misfits, and outcasts. The group is instantly entranced by the club and its owner.

Giselle is mysterious and alluring, and the group quickly falls under her spell. They start spending more and more time at the club, and Giselle starts to share her own art with them. She tells them stories of her life, of her love for dance, and of the heartbreak that led her to open the club.

As the group gets closer to Giselle, they start to uncover her secrets. They discover that she is not who she says she is, and that the club is a front for a much more dangerous operation. Giselle is a criminal mastermind, and the club is a cover for her smuggling operation.

Despite the danger, the group can't stay away from Giselle or the club. They are drawn in by her charisma and the sense of adventure that surrounds her. As they get deeper into her world, they start to realize that they are in over their heads.

The group is caught up in a web of intrigue and danger, and they must use all their skills to survive. They must outwit the police, outsmart the criminals, and stay one step ahead of Giselle. In the end, they will have to choose between the life they once knew and the dangerous world they are now a part of.
