The year is 1920 and China is in the midst of a civil war. The country is divided between the communist forces of the Red Army and the Nationalist forces of the Kuomintang. The two sides are fighting for control of the country, and the fate of China hangs in the balance.

In the midst of this chaos, a group of bandits known as the "Red Dragon" gang has emerged. They are a ruthless group of criminals who terrorize the countryside, robbing and killing anyone who gets in their way. The Red Dragon gang is led by a vicious killer named "The Butcher" who takes great pleasure in torturing and murdering his victims.

The Butcher and his gang are particularly feared by the people of the small village of Sanxing. The villagers have suffered greatly at the hands of the Red Dragon gang, and they are desperate for help.

One day, a stranger arrives in the village. He is a big man with a scar on his face, and he goes by the name of "The Stranger." The Stranger is a mystery man who has come to the village on a mission. He is looking for a man named "The Blacksmith."

The Stranger soon discovers that The Blacksmith is the head of the resistance against the Red Dragon gang. The Blacksmith is a skilled fighter and a brave man who has been leading the fight against the bandits. The Stranger offers to help The Blacksmith and his people in their fight against the Red Dragon gang.

The Blacksmith and The Stranger quickly develop a plan to take down the Red Dragon gang. They gather the villagers and arm them with anything they can find - farm tools, knives, and even old rifles.

One night, the Red Dragon gang comes to the village. The Butcher and his men begin to terrorize the villagers, but The Blacksmith and The Stranger are ready for them. The villagers fight back with all their might, and a fierce battle ensues.

The Butcher is a vicious fighter, but he is no match for The Blacksmith and The Stranger. The two men team up and fight like demons, finally defeating The Butcher and his gang. The Red Dragon gang is destroyed, and the village is saved.
