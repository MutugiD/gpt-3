==========

France, 1960s. A young woman, Jeanne, is found brutally murdered in a seedy alleyway. The police are baffled by the case, as there are no clues or leads as to who the killer could be.

The case takes a turn when another woman, Simone, comes forward and confesses to the crime. However, something about her story doesn't add up, and the police remain skeptical.

Simone is eventually cleared of the crime, but the real killer is still out there.

 Jeanne's cousin, Marie, is determined to find the killer and bring them to justice. She teams up with a private detective, Pierre, and together they begin to piece together the puzzle of who killed Jeanne.

As they get closer to the truth, they realize that the killer is someone much closer to home than they ever could have imagined.

The story culminates in a heart-wrenching climax as the killer is finally brought to justice.
