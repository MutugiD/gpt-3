Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a horror & thriller film set in India during the Renaissance. The story should be heartwarming & lighthearted. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

The film opens with a scene of utter chaos. A group of men and women are running through the streets, being chased by a horde of sickly looking people. They're being bitten and scratched, and as they run, they turn into the sickly people themselves.

The group manage to make it to a safe haven - a large estate owned by a wealthy nobleman. The estate is surrounded by a high wall, and the group is able to barricade themselves inside.

For the next few months, the group does their best to survive. They ration their food and water, and try to keep the infected people from getting in. But the longer they stay barricaded in, the more desperate they become.

One day, a small group of people arrives at the estate, seeking refuge. They say they've been traveling for weeks, and have seen no signs of the infection. The group let them in, and for a while, things seem to be going well.

But soon, the new arrivals begin to act strange. They start staying up all night, and their eyes start to turn red. The group realizes that they've been infected, and they prepare to defend themselves.

A bloody battle ensues, and in the end, the group of survivors is victorious. But they know that this is only the beginning, and that the infection is far from over.
