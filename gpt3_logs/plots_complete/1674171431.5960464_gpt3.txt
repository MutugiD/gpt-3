==========

In the early 1990s, a series of brutal murders terrorizes the city of Rome. The victims are all young women, and the police have no leads. They suspect that the killer is a woman, but they can't be sure.

As the murders continue, the city is plunged into fear. People are afraid to go out at night, and many women stay home, afraid to be the next victim.

The police are under pressure to catch the killer, but they seem to be getting nowhere. One of the detectives, a woman named Anna, is especially determined to catch the killer. She begins to piece together the clues, and she soon realizes that the killer is targeting young women who resemble her.

As the body count rises, Anna is racing against time to catch the killer before she claims another victim. But the killer is one step ahead of her, and she seems to be toying with the police.

The suspense builds to a fever pitch as the killer's identity is finally revealed. But the true horror is only just beginning.
