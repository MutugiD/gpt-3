Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a action & adventure film set in India during the Renaissance. The story should be tragic & heartwrenching. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

In the early 16th century, India is in the midst of a period of great political and cultural upheaval. The Mughal Empire is in decline, and the country is being torn apart by warring factions. In the midst of this chaos, a young woman named Jahanara falls in love with a warrior named Dara. Dara is a member of the royal family, and Jahanara is a commoner, so their relationship is forbidden. But they are willing to risk everything to be together.

Jahanara and Dara must fight for their love against the forces of intolerance and bigotry. They must also contend with Dara's ambitious brother, Aurangzeb, who is determined to seize the throne at any cost. As the country descends into civil war, Jahanara and Dara must fight for their lives and their love.

The story ends tragically, with Jahanara and Dara being killed in the fighting. But their love endures, and their story inspires other lovers to fight for their own happiness in the face of adversity.
