==========

In the 1920s, China was a country in turmoil. Crime and corruption were rampant, and the government was in a state of flux. Into this maelstrom stepped a young man named Zhou Enlai. A former bureaucrat, Zhou was a gifted detective with a keen mind and a nose for trouble.

Zhou is contacted by a wealthy businessman, Zhao Ziyang, who is desperate to find his missing daughter, Mei. Zhao offers Zhou a large sum of money to track down Mei and bring her home safely.

Zhou begins his investigation by interviewing Mei's friends and acquaintances. He quickly discovers that Mei was involved with a man named Feng Xiaotian, a notorious gangster. Feng is known to be brutal and dangerous, and it is clear that he has Mei captive.

Zhou devises a plan to infiltrate Feng's gang and rescue Mei. He poses as a criminal and is soon accepted into the group. Feng takes a liking to Zhou and begins to confide in him, revealing his plans to expand his criminal empire.

One night, Feng takes Zhou to a secret meeting with other gangsters, where they discuss a plan to smuggle weapons into China from Japan. Zhou is appalled by their plan and realizes that he must stop them.

He hatches a daring plan to stop the shipment of weapons and expose the gangsters. He enlists the help of Mei's father and the two of them set a trap for the gangsters.

The plan is a success and the gangsters are arrested. Feng is killed in a shootout and Mei is rescued. Zhou returns to China a hero, his reputation as a great detective firmly established.
