==========

When Val and Alex move to the French countryside to start a new life, they had no idea what horrors awaited them. Over the course of one summer, they discover that their new home is haunted by a malicious spirit that isn't content to just haunt their house - it wants to destroy their lives. As the hauntings become more and more violent, Val and Alex realize that they must find a way to rid their home of the spirit before it destroys them completely.

With the help of a local priest, they learn that the only way to banish the spirit is to perform a exorcism. But as they begin to prepare for the ritual, they realize that the spirit is not going to give up without a fight.

As the violence of the hauntings escalates, Val and Alex must face their fears and battle the spirit to save their own lives.
