==========

The film opens with a voice-over by the protagonist, a young woman named Mei. She tells the story of her family, who were once a powerful and influential clan in China during the Renaissance. Her father was a great general who led the clan to many victories, but he was betrayed by his brother and killed. Her mother and sister were also killed, and Mei was the only one who escaped. She was taken in by a kindly old woman who taught her how to survive in the wilderness.

Mei grew up to be a fierce and skillful fighter. She swore to avenge her family and restore their honor. When she was old enough, she set out on her quest. She hunted down her father's betrayer and killed him. She also killed anyone who got in her way. She quickly became feared and respected by the people of China.

One day, Mei was challenged to a duel by a young woman named Ling. Ling was the daughter of the clan leader who had betrayed Mei's father. She was also a skilled fighter. The two women fought a brutal battle, but Mei emerged victorious. She spared Ling's life, but took her as a prisoner.

Mei took Ling back to the old woman's house. She nursed Ling back to health and the two women became close. Ling told Mei that she wanted to help her restore her family's honor. Mei was hesitant at first, but she eventually agreed.

The film culminates with a final battle between Mei's army and the clan that betrayed her father. It is a bloody and brutal battle, but Mei's army emerges victorious. Mei finally has her revenge and her family's honor is restored.
