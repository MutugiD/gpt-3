Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a horror & thriller film set in Italy during the Renaissance. The story should be tragic & heartwrenching. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

For centuries, the Gucci family has ruled over Florence with an iron fist. But when the head of the family, Gianni Gucci, is assassinated, the family's grip on the city begins to unravel. Grief-stricken and vengeful, his son, Alessandro, takes up the mantle of leadership. But when strange and unexplainable things begin happening in the city, he realizes that he may be up against something far more powerful than he ever could have imagined.

Alessandro begins to consult with an eerie, dark-eyed soothsayer who warns him of an evil force that is coming for the Gucci family. As the city is beset by a rising tide of violence and terror, Alessandro comes to believe that the soothsayer is right and that the evil force is none other than the spirit of his father, returned from the dead to take revenge on those who murdered him.

To save his family and his city, Alessandro must find a way to stop the ghost of his father before it destroys everything he holds dear. But as he gets closer to the truth, he realizes that the ghost is only a manifestation of his own guilt and grief, and that the only way to stop it is to confront his own demons.

A heart-wrenching story of love, loss, and redemption, the film is a haunting portrait of a city consumed by fear and despair.
