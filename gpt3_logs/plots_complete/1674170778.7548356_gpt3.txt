The rebels are fighting against the government, who they believe is corrupt. They are also fighting against the militants, who are terrorizing the civilian population. Maya joins the rebels and quickly becomes one of their most skilled fighters.

The rebels launch a series of daring attacks against the government and the militants. They quickly gain ground, and the tide begins to turn in the civil war.

Maya becomes a symbol of hope for the people of India. She is seen as a brave and unstoppable force, and she leads the rebels to victory.
