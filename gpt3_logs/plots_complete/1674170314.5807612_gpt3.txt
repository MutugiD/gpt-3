Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a crime & mystery film set in India during the 1920s. The story should be gritty & dark. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

In the early 1920s, India is a country in turmoil. The British Raj is in control, but there is a growing movement of nationalists who want independence. Into this mix comes a series of brutal murders. The victims are all young women, and they are all found with their throats slit.

 Inspector Jai Mathur is put in charge of the case, and he quickly finds himself up against a wall. There are no leads and no suspects. But Jai is determined to solve the case, even if it means working day and night.

As he digs deeper, Jai realizes that the murders are just the tip of the iceberg. There is a much darker plot at play, one that goes all the way to the top of the British Raj. With the help of his loyal assistant, Jai must race against the clock to stop the killers before they can strike again.

The plot twists and turns, leading Jai and his assistant down a dark and dangerous path. But in the end, they find justice for the victims and expose the true evil that has been hiding in plain sight.
