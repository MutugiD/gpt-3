==========

In the city of Agra, India, a series of grisly murders have been committed. The victims are all women, and they have all been brutally tortured and killed. The city is in a state of panic, and the authorities are desperately trying to find the killer before he can strike again.

Detective Rakesh Singh is assigned to the case, and he quickly realizes that this is no ordinary killer. The murderer is clearly very intelligence and has a deep understanding of the human psyche. He knows exactly how to torture his victims to get them to reveal their deepest, darkest secrets.

As the murders continue, Singh begins to put together the pieces of the puzzle. He comes to realize that the killer is targeting women who he believes have sinned in some way. He is seeking to punish them for their supposed crimes.

 Singh is able to track down the killer and confront him. The killer is a religious fanatic who believes that he is doing the work of God. He is convinced that the women he has killed deserve to be punished.

In the end, Singh is able to talk the killer down and convince him to turn himself in. The city is finally able to breath a sigh of relief, knowing that the killer is no longer on the loose.
