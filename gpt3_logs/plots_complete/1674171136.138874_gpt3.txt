Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a horror & thriller film set in Italy during the 1960s. The story should be heartwarming & lighthearted. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

The movie opens with a bang, literally. We see a figure in a black cape and hood running through the dark, deserted streets of a small Italian town. The figure is being pursued by a group of men with torches and dogs. They corner the figure in an alley, but when they get there, the figure has disappeared.

The next day, we meet our main character, Caterina. Caterina is a young woman who has just moved to Italy from America with her new husband, Marco. Marco is a successful businessman, and Caterina is an aspiring writer. They are both very happy with their new life in Italy.

One night, Caterina is home alone and she hears a noise outside. She looks out the window and sees the figure in the black cape and hood running through the streets again. She watches as the figure is cornered by the same group of men with torches and dogs. This time, they catch the figure and uncover its identity: it is a small, furry creature with long claws and teeth.

The men take the creature to the local zoo, where it is put on display for the public. Caterina is fascinated by the creature and visits it often. She starts to feel sorry for it, and she decides to set it free.

Caterina sneaks into the zoo at night and opens the cage of the creature. The creature escapes, and Caterina is pursued by the men with torches and dogs again. She leads them on a chase through the streets, but she eventually loses them.

The creature is now on the loose, and it starts to terrorize the town. It kills animals and people, and it seems to be getting bigger and more ferocious with each kill. The townspeople are terrified, and they start to blame Caterina for releasing the creature.

 Marco is getting worried about Caterina, and he doesn't want her to get hurt. He tells her that she needs to leave town and go back to America. Caterina doesn't want to leave, but she knows that Marco is right.

She packs her bags and prepares to leave, but the creature appears and attacks her. Caterina manages to fight it off and she kills it with a knife. She is covered in blood, but she is alive.

The movie ends with Caterina boarding a plane to America. She is traumatized by her experience, but she is also stronger than she was before. She has learned that monsters can be real, but she also knows that she is capable of defeating them.
