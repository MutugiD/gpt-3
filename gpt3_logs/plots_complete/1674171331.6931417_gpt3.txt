==========

The film opens in India, circa 1920. We are introduced to our protagonist, a young woman named Mallika, who is married to a wealthy man. Mallika is unhappy in her marriage and is constantly neglected by her husband. One night, she is visited by a mysterious stranger who tells her that she has the power to kill her husband with just a thought. The stranger also tells her that if she does kill her husband, she will inherit his fortune. Mallika is tempted by the stranger's offer and decides to kill her husband. 

The next day, Mallika's husband is found dead, and she is the prime suspect. However, the police are unable to find any evidence linking her to the crime. Mallika is free to go, but she is now a woman with a secret. The stranger visits her again and tells her that she must now kill someone else, or he will kill her. Mallika is horrified by the stranger's demands, but she knows that she must do as he says.

The film follows Mallika as she kills several more people, all while being pursued by the police. She is constantly haunted by the stranger's threats and is desperate to find a way to kill him. However, the stranger is always one step ahead of her. The film reaches its climax when Mallika finally faces off against the stranger. She learns that he is actually a demon who has been feeding off of her kills. In a final battle, she defeats the demon and is relieved to finally be free of his terror.
