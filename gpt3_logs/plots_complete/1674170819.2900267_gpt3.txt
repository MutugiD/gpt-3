==========

In the gritty and dark action & adventure film set in China during the 1990s, our protagonist is a young girl who has been orphaned and is living on the streets. She is incredibly street-wise and resourceful, and has managed to stay alive by her wits alone. One day, she witnesses a brutal murder being carried out by a local gangster and she is seen by him. He gives chase, but she manages to lose him and escape. 

The gangster is a powerful man in the local underworld, and he will not stop until he finds the girl and kills her. She knows that she cannot go back to her old life, and so she begins to plan her escape from the city. She starts to gather supplies and money, and reaches out to a contact who can help her get out of the city. 

Meanwhile, the gangster is putting together a large force to find the girl and kill her. He offers a large reward for anyone who can bring her to him, dead or alive. As she is making her preparations to leave, she is constantly looking over her shoulder, expecting the gangster's goons to come after her at any moment. 

One night, as she is about to leave the city, she is ambushed by the gangster and his men. She is outnumbered and outgunned, but she fights like a wild animal, determined to not be caught. In the end, she is fatally wounded, but she manages to take out a few of the gangster's men with her. The gangster stands over her, victorious. 

As he is about to deliver the killing blow, she smiles up at him and says, "You'll never find me. I'll always be one step ahead of you." With her last breath, she dies. But her story is not over yet. 

The gangster is now obsessed with finding the girl's buried body and destroying it, so that her spirit will not be able to haunt him. He will go to any lengths to find her body, and the film ends with him looking for her in the vast Chinese countryside, still searching for her even though she is long gone.
