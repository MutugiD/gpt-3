Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a horror & thriller film set in France during the 1990s. The story should be tragic & heartwrenching. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

The 1990s was a dark and heartless time in France. The country was plagued by a series of brutal murders, many of which were never solved. One of these murders was the case of a young woman who was found brutally murdered in a Paris alleyway. The case remained unsolved for years, until a new Detective is assigned to the case and begins to piece together the clues.

The Detective soon discovers that the young woman was just one of many victims of a deranged serial killer who was targeting young women in Paris. The killer, who became known as the "Alleyway Butcher", would lure his victims into secluded alleyways before killing them and leaving their bodies to be discovered.

As the Detective begins to close in on the killer, he realizes that the murders are personal to the killer and that he may be targeting the Detective himself. The Detective must race against the clock to catch the killer before he claims another victim, including the Detective himself.

The film culminates in a heart-pounding finale as the Detective and the killer face off in a showdown. The killer is finally brought to justice, but not before he claims one final victim. The film ends on a somber note, with the Detective reflecting on the tragedy of the case and the many lives that were lost.
