Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a romance & comedy film set in China during the 1960s. The story should be gritty & dark. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

college student Fangping falls in love with her professor, Zhou. However, Zhou is married and unavailable. Fangping is aware of this, but she cannot help but be drawn to him.

One day, Zhou's wife finds out about the affair and confronts Fangping. She threatens to go to the authorities and have Fangping arrested if she does not leave her husband alone. Fangping agrees, but she is heartbroken.

A few months later, Fangping finds out that she is pregnant with Zhou's child. She knows that she cannot keep the baby, but she does not want to abort it either. She decides to give birth to the child and give it up for adoption.

Fangping realises that she cannot go through with the adoption and decides to keep the child. She faces many challenges as a single mother in China during the 1960s, but she is determined to make it work.

The child, a girl, is born healthy and happy. Fangping names her Zhou, after her father.

Fangping and Zhou's daughter grows up to be a strong and independent woman. She eventually learns about her parents' history and comes to understand the sacrifices that her mother made for her.
