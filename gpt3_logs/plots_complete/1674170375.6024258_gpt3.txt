==========

set in Rome in the 1990's, 

The city is gritty and dark, full of crime and mystery. The streets are full of scammers, thieves, and killers. The protagonist is a young woman, a recent college graduate who has come to Rome to start her new life. She's been warned about the city, but she's determined to make it on her own. She finds an apartment in a quiet neighborhood and starts to settle in. 

But the city is not what it seems. The crime and mystery are not just on the surface. They start to seep into her life, her apartment, her relationships. She starts to see shadows everywhere, to feel like she's being watched. And then, one night, she comes home to find her front door open and her apartment ransacked. 

She's been robbed, but that's not all. The thieves have also taken her passport and her money. She's stranded in a city she doesn't know, with no way to get home. 

But the thief has made a mistake. He's underestimated her. She's not going to just give up and go home. She's going to find him, and she's going to get her revenge. 

The film follows her as she navigates the city, learning about the underground world of crime and corruption. She makes allies and enemies, and finally, she catches up to the thief. But the confrontation is not what she expected, and she's left to question everything she thought she knew about the city, and about herself.
