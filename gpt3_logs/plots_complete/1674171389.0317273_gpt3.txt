==========

In the gritty and dark China of the 1990s, a young woman named Ling is trying to make her way in the world. She's intelligent and resourceful, but she's up against some pretty big obstacles. For one thing, she's from a poor family, and for another, she's constantly being pestered by men who think she's easy prey.

One night, Ling is out walking by herself when she's attacked by a group of men. She fights them off as best she can, but she's outnumbered and outmatched. They manage to drag her off to a dark, secluded spot, where they proceed to rape her.

Ling is traumatized by the attack, but she's not one to take it lying down. She starts to train in self-defense, and she becomes obsessed with finding her attackers and making them pay.

She finally track them down, and one by one, she systematically takes them out. She makes them suffer before she kills them, making sure that they understand exactly what they did to her and why they're paying the ultimate price.

In the end, Ling is left a changed woman, but she's also stronger and more confident. She's finally able to move on from her attack and build a new life for herself.
