==========

In the 1920s, India is a country in turmoil. The British rule is coming to an end, but the future is uncertain. The people are caught between the past and the present, between tradition and change.

A young woman, Jahanara, is caught up in the middle of this turmoil. She is a student at the University of Calcutta, and she is also a member of the Indian National Congress, a political party fighting for independence from the British.

Jahanara is idealistic and passionate, and she believes in the power of non-violent protests. But when the Congress decides to take up arms against the British, she is forced to choose between her ideals and her country.

The film follows Jahanara as she tries to navigate the complex political landscape of India, and as she struggles to find her place in a country that is changing rapidly.

The film is set against the backdrop of the Indian independence movement, and it is a story of love, loss, and betrayal.
