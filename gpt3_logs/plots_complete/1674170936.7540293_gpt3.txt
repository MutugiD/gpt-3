==========

The film opens in present day Beijing, where a young woman named Mei is researching her family history. She comes across a mysterious document dating back to the Ming Dynasty, which tells the story of her ancestor, a woman named Zhen. Zhen was married to a wealthy man, but she was always fascinated by the occult. She began dabbling in black magic, and eventually caught the attention of a powerful sorcerer who took her as his apprentice.

Zhen quickly rose to power within the sorcerer's coven, and soon became one of the most feared practitioners of dark magic in China. She used her powers to manipulate her husband and gain control of his business empire. She also used her magic to kill anyone who stood in her way.

As Zhen's power grew, the sorcerer became worried that she would eventually overthrow him. He decided to send her on a mission to a small village in the countryside, where she would be tasked with killing a young woman who was prophesied to one day lead a revolt against the sorcerer's coven.

Zhen arrived in the village and tracked down the woman, but she was unexpectedly attacked by a group of villagers who had figured out her true identity. Zhen fought back with her magic, but she was outnumbered and outmatched. The villagers eventually captured her and burned her at the stake.

As Zhen died, she cursed the villagers, promising that her spirit would one day return to take revenge.

The film then cuts to present day, where the village is now a tourist destination. People from all over China come to see the site of Zhen's death. However, they don't know that her spirit is still very much alive.

At night, Zhen's spirit begins to haunt the village, using her magic to kill anyone who steps foot in her domain. The village quickly becomes a hotbed of paranormal activity, and the government sends in a team of scientists to investigate.

As the scientists begin to piece together what is happening, they realize that they are dealing with a very powerful and evil spirit. They must find a way to stop Zhen before she destroys the village and kills everyone in it.

The film ends with a showdown between the scientists and Zhen's spirit. In the end, the scientists are able to banish her back to the other side, saving the village and its inhabitants.
