The help of an nameless diary, 

In the 1960s in India, a young woman named Ratna is secretly writing in a diary that she hides under her mattress. She writes about her dark and hidden desires, as well as her fears and anxieties. One night, she is woken up by a noise outside her window. She looks out to see a figure in the shadows watching her. Ratna is terrified and does not know who this person is or what they want. The next day, she goes to the local police station to report the incident, but they do not believe her. The police tell her that she is imagining things and that she should go home. Ratna is even more frightened now and does not know what to do. She decides to take matters into her own hands and finds a way to track down the figure. She follows them to an abandoned building, where she is attacked. Ratna fights back and manages to escape, but the figure is never found. The incident leaves her traumatized and she begins to spiral into a dark depression. She stops writing in her diary and starts to isolate herself from her family and friends. Ratna's mental state continues to deteriorate until one day, she snaps and goes on a rampage, killing several people before being shot and killed by the police. The diary is found next to her body and it is revealed that the figure she was following was her own split personality that she had been repressing.
