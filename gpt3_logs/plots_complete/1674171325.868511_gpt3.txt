Set in India during the Renaissance, "The Black Lotus" is a gritty and dark horror thriller that tells the story of a young girl named Maya who is sold into slavery and taken to a remote palace in the Himalayas. There, she is forced to serve the cruel and tyrannical queen, who is obsessed with a black lotus flower that is said to have magical powers.

Maya is constantly subjected to horrific abuse at the hands of the queen and her guards, but she never gives up hope of escaping. One day, she manages to steal the key to the queen's chambers and discovers a secret passage leading outside the palace. She makes her escape and is hunted through the jungle by the queen's henchmen.

Maya finally reaches a small village, where she is taken in by a kindly old woman. She learns that the queen is actually a witch who has been using the black lotus to drain the life force from young girls in order to stay young and beautiful.

The old woman tells Maya that she is the only one who can stop the queen and destroy the black lotus. Maya sets out to find the witch and put an end to her evil reign of terror.

The film culminates in a spectacular battle between Maya and the queen, in which Maya finally destroys the black lotus and defeats the witch.
