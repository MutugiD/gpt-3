A young woman, named Elise, is living in France during the 1920s. She is deeply in love with a man named Philippe, who is also her best friend. Philippe is a charming and charismatic man who always seems to be getting into trouble. Elise is constantly worrying about him and trying to keep him out of trouble. One night, while Elise is at home and Philippe is out with friends, she gets a call from the police. They tell her that Philippe has been arrested for murder. Elise is shocked and devastated. She immediately goes to the police station to try to help him. However, the evidence against Philippe is very strong and the police refuse to listen to Elise. They tell her that he will be going to trial and she will need to find a lawyer. Elise is frantic and does not know what to do. She does not have any money for a lawyer and she knows that Philippe will not be able to afford one either. Elise is desperate and decides to take matters into her own hands. She begins to investigate the murder herself. She talks to witnesses and looks at the evidence. Slowly, she pieces together what happened. She comes to the conclusion that Philippe is innocent and that he was framed for the murder. Elise is now in a race against time to find the real killer before Philippe is convicted and sent to prison for life.
