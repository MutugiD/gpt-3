Moreau follows their trail to a small village in the south of France. He finds them in a secluded farmhouse. They are happy and content, but Moreau knows that their happiness is fleeting. He tells them that he has been hired by Marguerite's father to bring her back home.

The lovers plead with Moreau to let them go, but he is adamant. He tells them that they must face the consequences of their actions. Moreau takes them back to Marguerite's father.
