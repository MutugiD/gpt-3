Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a action & adventure film set in France during the 1990s. The story should be gritty & dark. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

In the early 1990s, a group of criminals in France begin to work together to commit a series of high-profile robberies. The group is made up of a mastermind, a skilled driver, a talented locksmith, and a violent enforcer. They quickly become the most feared criminal group in the country.

The police are desperately trying to catch them, but they always seem to be one step ahead. The criminals are able to pull off daring heists and escape cleanly. Over time, the police begin to piece together clues that suggest that the group is based in Paris.

As the police close in on their location, the criminals become more desperate and dangerous. They pull off a series of increasingly dangerous heists, but each time they narrowly escape capture. Finally, the police corner the criminals in a remote cabin in the woods.

After a lengthy standoff, the criminals are finally captured. The film ends with the criminals being led away in handcuffs, while the police celebrate their victory.
