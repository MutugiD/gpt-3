==========

When crumbling estate owner, Gioia, meets dashing gentleman, Giancarlo, she falls head over heels in love. Giancarlo seems to be the perfect match for Gioia and her three daughters. However, Giancarlo is actually a fortune hunter who is only interested in Gioia for her money. 

Giancarlo begins to woo Gioia, and she is quickly swept off her feet. They are soon married, and Gioia moves her entire family to Giancarlo’s estate. Giancarlo starts to spend all of Gioia’s money, and he begins to neglect her. Gioia’s daughters start to resent Giancarlo, and they try to warn their mother about him. 

Giancarlo’s true colors begin to show, and he starts to verbally and emotionally abuse Gioia. Gioia is completely devoted to Giancarlo, and she tries to make the best of the situation. However, she is slowly being driven mad by Giancarlo’s abuse. 

One night, after a particularly bad argument, Giancarlo pushes Gioia down the stairs. Gioia is seriously injured, and she is confined to a wheelchair. Giancarlo continues to mistreat Gioia, and her daughters are left to care for her. 

Gioia’s mental state deteriorates, and she becomes a shell of her former self. Her daughters are desperate to help her, but they are powerless against Giancarlo. Finally, after years of abuse, Gioia snaps and she kills Giancarlo. 

Gioia is put on trial for Giancarlo’s murder, and her daughters testify against her. Gioia is found guilty and she is sentenced to life in prison. Her daughters are devastated, but they visit her frequently and they vow to never let her be forgotten.
