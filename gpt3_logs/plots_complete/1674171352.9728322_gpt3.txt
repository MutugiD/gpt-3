Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a horror & thriller film set in India during the 1990s. The story should be gritty & dark. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

film opens with a scene of a dark, stormy night. A young woman is seen running through the streets, her face is covered in terror and she is clutching a small bundle to her chest. She is being chased by a group of men, their faces also hidden in the shadows. The woman is cornered against a wall and the men close in on her, just as she is about to be caught, she screams and the 
screen goes black.

The next scene opens with the woman, who is now revealed to be named Jaya, waking up from a nightmare. We see that she is pregnant and living in a small apartment in Mumbai with her husband, Arjun. Arjun is a police officer who is working on a case involving a series of brutal murders of young women. The murders have been happening for the past few months and the police have been unable to catch the killer. 

Jaya is terrified of the killer and is convinced that he will come after her and her unborn child. Arjun does his best to reassure her and keep her safe, but she is still scared. Arjun is called away on a case and Jaya is left home alone. She starts to hear strange noises and is convinced that someone is stalking her. She tries to leave the apartment but the doors and windows are locked from the inside. Suddenly, the power goes out and she is plunged into darkness. 

She hears someone coming towards her and she runs and hides in the bathroom. The door bursts open and she is face to face with the killer. He chases her and she tries to escape, but he catches her and stabs her to death.

The final scene shows Arjun coming home to find Jaya's dead body. He is devastated and we see him crumble to the ground as he breaks down in tears. The killer is never caught and the film ends with a shot of Arjun sitting in the dark, empty apartment, traumatized by what has happened.
