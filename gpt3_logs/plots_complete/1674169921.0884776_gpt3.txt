Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a crime & mystery film set in India during the 1960s. The story should be cerebral & suspenseful. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

The film opens in India in the 1960s. A group of criminals has just pulled off a heist, and are in the process of making their escape. However, one of the members of the group is shot and killed during the escape, and the others are forced to leave him behind. 

The group makes it safely to their hideout, where they divvy up the loot and count their losses. One of the members of the group, a woman named Jai, is particularly distraught over the death of her partner. She blames the leader of the group, a man named Raj, for his death. 

Jai confronts Raj, and the two argue. Raj insists that it was necessary to leave the man behind, but Jai doesn't see the sense in it. The argument turns violent, and Jai eventually kills Raj. The rest of the group is horrified, but Jai is unrepentant. 

With Raj out of the way, Jai takes over the group. She plans to make a clean getaway, but the rest of the group is hesitant to trust her. They're not sure if she can be trusted, but they have no other choice but to follow her lead. 

The group makes their way to the airport, but Jai's plans start to unravel when one of the members is recognized by a security guard. The guard calls for backup, and the group is soon surrounded by the police. 

Jai is captured, but the rest of the group manages to escape. They scatter in different directions, and Jai is taken into custody. 

Jai is interrogated by the police, but she refuses to talk. She's sentenced to life in prison, where she spends the rest of her days. 

The film ends with a shot of Jai in her cell, looking out the window as she contemplates her life and her choices.
