Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a horror & thriller film set in Italy during the 1960s. The story should be cerebral & suspenseful. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

In the 1960s, a group of American tourists are traveling through Italy when they make the mistake of staying in an old, rundown hotel in the middle of nowhere. It isn't long before they realize that the hotel is haunted by the ghosts of its past guests, who were all murdered in a brutal massacre. The tourists must now band together and use their own wits and resources to survive the night and figure out how to escape the hotel alive.

As the sun sets and night falls, the tourists begin to experience strange and eerie phenomena in the hotel. The doors and windows are locked shut, and they can't seem to find a way out. They hear strange noises and see strange shadows moving around in the corridors. Some of the guests even disappear, and no one knows where they've gone.

As the night wears on, the ghosts become more aggressive and start to attack the guests. They're relentless in their pursuit, and no one is safe. The guests start to turn on each other, and it becomes clear that not everyone will make it out alive. In the end, only a few guests manage to escape the hotel, and the rest are left behind to die.
