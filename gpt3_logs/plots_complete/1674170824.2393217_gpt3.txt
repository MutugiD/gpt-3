Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a action & adventure film set in Italy during the Renaissance. The story should be gritty & dark. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

In Renaissance Italy, a group of mercenaries are hired by the ruling Medici family to protect them from their enemies. The mercenaries, known as the Black Band, are a force to be reckoned with, and they quickly gain a reputation for being ruthless and unstoppable.

However, there is one man who is determined to stop the Black Band, and he will stop at nothing to do so. His name is Cesare Borgia, and he is the leader of the rival Orsini family. Borgia is a master strategist, and he soon starts to chip away at the Black Band's strength, slowly but surely weakening them.

As the Black Band's numbers start to dwindle, they become desperate, and they start to resort to increasingly desperate measures. Finally, Borgia sees his chance to strike, and he launches a full-scale assault on the Medici family.

In the end, Borgia is successful, and the Medici family is destroyed. The Black Band is no more, and Italy is plunged into chaos.
