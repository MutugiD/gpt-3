==========

When Marie (27) is tragically widowed, she moves from her small town in the French countryside to Paris to start fresh. There, she meets a man named Philippe (30) who quickly sweeps her off her feet. Philippe is charming, handsome, and comes from a wealthy family - everything Marie could have ever wanted in a partner. They get married soon after meeting and seem to be living the perfect life. 

However, Philippe is hiding a dark secret: he is cheating on Marie with his ex-girlfriend, Isabelle. Marie eventually finds out about the affair and is devastated. She confronts both Philippe and Isabelle, but they deny the affair and gaslight Marie into thinking she's crazy. 

Heartbroken, Marie moves out of their shared apartment and into a small studio. She falls into a deep depression and starts relying on alcohol to get through the days. Philippe and Isabelle continue their affair behind Marie's back, and she remains none the wiser. 

One day, Marie runs into Philippe and Isabelle while they're out on a date. She's drunk and loudly confronts them, causing a scene. The two finally admit to the affair and dump her on the side of the road. Marie is humiliated and decides she's had enough. 

She takes all the money she has saved up and buys a one-way ticket to Spain. She starts a new life there, working as a barista and slowly putting her life back together. She meets a man named Julio (25) who helps her heal and learn to love again. The two eventually fall in love and get married. Marie is finally happy and has found her new home.
