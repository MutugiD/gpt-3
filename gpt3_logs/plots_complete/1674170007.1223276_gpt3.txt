==========

Auguste Dupin is a world-renowned detective living in Paris during the Renaissance. He is called upon to solve a mystery surrounding the death of a young nobleman. The victim's body was found in a secluded alley, his throat slit from ear to ear.

The only clues at the scene are a small piece of parchment with the words "the black cat" written on it, and a black cat that was seen running from the alley shortly after the body was discovered.

Dupin begins his investigation by interviewing the victim's family and friends. He quickly discovers that the victim was a cruel and abusive man who had many enemies. He also learns that the victim had recently adopted a black cat that he kept locked in his room.

Dupin decides to question the black cat. He tricks the cat into revealing that it was present when the victim was killed. The cat saw the killer, but is terrified and will not reveal the killer's identity.

Dupin continues his investigation and eventually discovers that the victim's wife was the killer. She killed him in revenge for years of abuse. She then tried to frame the black cat for the murder, knowing that it would be put to death.

Dupin apprehends the wife and clears the black cat's name. The cat is adopted by Dupin and lives with him for the rest of his days.
