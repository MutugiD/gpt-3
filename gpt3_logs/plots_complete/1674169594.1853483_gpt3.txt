==========

In France during the Renaissance, Marguerite (30) is a beautiful and successful artist who has everything she could ever want. Her life is perfect until she meets Pierre (32), a handsome and charming man who swept her off her feet. They fall madly in love and get married, but Pierre is not the perfect man he appeared to be. He is a womanizer and a gambler, and he soon runs through all of Marguerite's money. He also starts to mistreat her, making her life a living hell. 

Marguerite is miserable but she does not want to leave Pierre because she still loves him, despite everything he has done to her. However, she eventually realizes that she needs to get away from him before he destroys her completely. She divorces him and moves to a different city, where she tries to rebuild her life. 

But Pierre is not ready to let her go. He follows her to the new city and starts stalking her, showing up everywhere she goes. He also starts to spread rumors about her, trying to ruin her reputation. Marguerite is at her wit's end and she does not know how to make Pierre stop. 

Finally, she decides to take matters into her own hands. She lures Pierre into a trap and kills him, freeing herself from his grasp at last. The film ends with Marguerite finally being able to move on with her life and start fresh, free from Pierre's tyranny.
