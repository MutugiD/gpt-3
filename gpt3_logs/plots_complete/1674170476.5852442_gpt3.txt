In Renaissance Italy, a skilled thief named Antonio is enlisted by a powerful cardinal to steal a priceless relic from a rival cardinal. The heist is successful, but Antonio is caught and sentenced to death.

In prison, Antonio is visited by a beautiful woman named Isabella, who offers to help him escape if he agrees to help her recover a lost treasure. Antonio agrees, and the two of them break out of prison and go on a daring treasure hunt through the Italian countryside.

During their adventure, they face off against rival treasure hunters, warring factions, and deadly traps, all while trying to stay one step ahead of the pursuing guards. Ultimately, they find the treasure they were looking for, but not before Antonio and Isabella have fallen in love with each other.
