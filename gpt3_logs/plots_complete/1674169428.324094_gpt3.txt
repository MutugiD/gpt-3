==========

Opening scene: 

The film opens with a montage of shots, set to music, of Italy during the Renaissance. We see beautiful landscapes, art, and architecture as the camera pans and zooms in on different locations. We hear a voiceover narration by the protagonist, Beatrice, as she talks about her love for her country and its rich history. 

We then see Beatrice walking through a busy market square in Florence. She is stopped by a young boy who begs for money. Beatrice gives him a few coins and continues on her way. She comes to a stop in front of a statue of David and gazes at it admiringly. We hear her voiceover again as she talks about how the statue represents the perfect male form. 

Suddenly, Beatrice is interrupted by a man, Giovanni, who tries to flirt with her. She is not interested and tried to walk away, but he persists. He finally gives up and walks away. Beatrice continues on her way, but she is now followed by Giovanni. She turns around and scolds him, telling him to leave her alone. He apologizes and vows to never bother her again.

Beatrice finally arrives at her destination, an art studio. We see hermeet with her teacher, Leonardo da Vinci. He shows her a new painting he is working on and she is amazed. We hear her voiceover again as she talks about how Leonardo is a genius and how she is privileged to be able to learn from him. 

The scene switches to Beatrice walking home from the art studio. We see her pass by the market square again and she is accosted by the same young boy from earlier. He asks her for money again and she gives him a few coins. We see a closeup of the boy's face and he looks dirty and hungry. Beatrice feels sorry for him and asks his name. He tells her it is Angelo. 

She then asks him where he lives and he points to a rundown building on the other side of town. Beatrice tells him to come with her and she will take him home. Angelo is hesitant at first, but he eventually goes with her. 

The scene switches to Beatrice and Angelo arriving at Beatrice's home. Her father, Francisco, is there to greet them. He is not happy to see Angelo and tells him to leave. Beatrice scolds her father and tells him that Angelo is going to stay with them. Francisco is not happy about this, but he relents. 

The scene switches to Beatrice showing Angelo around the house. We see them bonding as she introduces him to her mother and siblings. We hear a voiceover by Beatrice as she talks about how she has always wanted a brother and how she is happy to have found Angelo. 

Later, we see Beatrice and Angelo in the garden. Beatrice is teaching him how to read and write. We hear a voiceover by Angelo as he talks about how he has never had a teacher before and how he is grateful to Beatrice for taking him in. 

As they are talking, Giovanni suddenly appears. He apologizes for following her earlier and asks if he can join them. Beatrice is hesitant at first, but she eventually relents. The three of them spend the rest of the afternoon together, talking and laughing. 

As the sun begins to set, Giovanni asks if he can see Beatrice again tomorrow. She agrees and he says goodbye. As he is leaving, he turns and gives Angelo a wink. Angelo is not sure what to make of this, but he is happy that Beatrice has found a friend.

The next day, we see Giovanni and Beatrice meeting again. This time, they are joined by Beatrice's best friend, Bianca. The three of them spend the day together, sightseeing and talking. We hear a voiceover by Beatrice as she talks about how she is starting to fall for Giovanni. 

Later that night, we see Beatrice in her room, writing in her diary. She talks about how she is confused about her feelings for Giovanni. On the one hand, she is attracted to him, but on the other hand, she is not sure if she can trust him. She decides to wait and see what happens. 

The following day, we see Angelo playing in the streets with some other boys. He is having fun, but he is also aware that he is different from the other boys. He does not have a daddy and he does not have a home. 

Suddenly, the boys start to make fun of him and they begin to chase him. Angelo runs away, but they eventually catch up to him. They start to beat him up, but he is saved by Giovanni. He scolds the boys and
