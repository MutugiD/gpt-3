Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a romance & comedy film set in China during the 1990s. The story should be gritty & dark. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

In the early 1990s, in the midst of China's economic boom, a young woman named Li Weiwei is working as a maid in a large city. She's from a small village and is uneducated, but she's determined to make something of herself. She meets a man named Chen Zhen, who's also from a small village and is working as a security guard. They fall in love and start a secret affair.

Li Weiwei is eventually fired from her job after her affair is discovered. She's heartbroken and embarrassed, but Chen Zhen is there to comfort her. He tells her that he's leaving his job, too, and that he wants to start a business with her. They open a small shop together and begin to build their lives together.

The shop does well, but Chen Zhen is always working and Li Weiwei feels like she's living in his shadow. She starts to feel suffocated and starts to doubt their relationship. In a moment of weakness, she sleeps with another man.

Chen Zhen finds out about the affair and is devastated. He throws Li Weiwei out of the shop and their lives begin to unravel. Li Weiwei is pregnant with the other man's child, but she's determined to win Chen Zhen back. She hatches a plan to get him to forgive her and take her back, and it works. They get back together and raise Li Weiwei's child as their own.

The film ends with a shot of the shop, now a thriving business, with Chen Zhen and Li Weiwei working together and their child playing in the background.
