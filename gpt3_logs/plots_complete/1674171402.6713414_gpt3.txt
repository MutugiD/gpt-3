==========

When young artist, Leonardo Da Vinci, is commissioned to paint a mural in the Duke of Milan's castle, he has no idea what he's getting himself into.

As he begins to work, he starts to notice strange things happening around him. The castle seems to be haunted and the Duke's wife is constantly watching him.

One night, Leonardo is finishing up the mural and he sees the Duke's wife coming towards him. She's covered in blood and she has a knife in her hand. She tells Leonardo that her husband is a monster and she's going to kill him.

Leonardo tries to stop her, but she stabs the Duke to death. As she's dying, she tells Leonardo that the Duke was possessed by a demon and he was going to kill Leonardo too.

 Leonardo is arrested for the murder and is sentenced to death. He's sent to prison, where he meets a woman who tells him that she can help him escape.

She takes him to a group of people who are also trying to escape the city. They're planning to leave that night, but they need Leonardo to help them.

Leonardo agrees to help them and they all start to make their way out of the city. However, they're being pursued by the demon-possessed Duke, who's now a ghost.

The Duke catches up to them and starts killing them one by one. However, Leonardo is able to use his knowledge of the Duke's castle to trap the Duke and destroy him.

The group is able to escape and they all live happily ever after.
