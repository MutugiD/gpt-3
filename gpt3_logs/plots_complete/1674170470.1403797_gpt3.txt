Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a action & adventure film set in China during the 1990s. The story should be cerebral & suspenseful. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail:

==========

The film opens with a young girl, Mei, playing in a rice paddy with her friends. It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining. Suddenly, a gunshot rings out and Mei's friends fall to the ground, dead. Mei is terrified and doesn't know what to do.

She runs towards her house, but a group of men come running towards her. She's about to be captured when a man, who we later learn is named Li, comes to her rescue. He kills the men who were after Mei and tells her to come with him.

Li takes Mei to a safe house where he and his fellow resistance fighters are hiding out. They're fighting against the Chinese government, who they believe is corrupt and oppressing the people.

Li and the others teach Mei how to fight and she quickly becomes a valuable asset to their cause. She's brave and determined, and she has a natural affinity for combat.

As the story progresses, we see Mei grow into a young woman. She's still fighting against the government, but she's also become Li's lover. The two of them have a deep connection and share a passion for justice.

Eventually, the resistance fighters overthrow the government and create a new, more democratic society. Mei and Li are instrumental in this victory, and they're hailed as heroes. They're finally able to live in peace and happiness together.
