==========

In Renaissance Italy, Sofia is a young woman who is deeply in love with Lorenzo, a handsome nobleman. Despite her parents' objections, the two become engaged. However, their happiness is short-lived when Lorenzo is killed in a duel.

Sofia is devastated by her loss, but finds comfort in her best friend, Gianna. Gianna is secretly in love with Sofia, but does not want to admit it, even to herself. However, she can't help but be there for Sofia as she grieves.

Slowly but surely, Sofia begins to heal and starts to move on with her life. She even begins to open her heart to new love. However, just when it seems like she is ready to move on, Lorenzo's ghost appears to her.

At first, Sofia is thrilled to see her beloved again. However, she soon realizes that Lorenzo is not at peace. He is angry and bitter about his death, and he wants revenge. He begs Sofia to help him, but she refuses.

Lorenzo's ghost then begins to haunt her. He appears to her in her dreams and in her waking life. He is always there, watching her and waiting. Sofia starts to become scared and paranoid, and she starts to lose her grip on reality.

Gianna is the only one who believes her, and she is there for her no matter what. Finally, after months of being haunted, Sofia snaps and tries to kill herself. Gianna stops her just in time, and finally confesses her love for Sofia.

Sofia is shocked, but she can't deny her own feelings. The two women embrace and finally give in to their love for each other. They start a new life together, free from the ghost of Lorenzo.
