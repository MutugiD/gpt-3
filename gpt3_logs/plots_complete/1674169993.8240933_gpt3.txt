==========

In Italy during the 1990s, a series of brutal murders take place. The victims are all young women, and the murders seem to be random and unconnected. The police are baffled, and the press is in a frenzy.

One night, a young woman named Mara is out walking alone when she is attacked and killed. However, her body is found the next day by a man named Giovanni, who is a former police detective. When Giovanni sees the crime scene, he realizes that there is a pattern to the murders.

Giovanni begins to investigate the murders, and he quickly realizes that all of the victims have something in common: they all worked at the same modelling agency. Furthermore, he discovers that the agency is connected to a powerful and dangerous crime syndicate.

Giovanni risks his life to uncover the truth, and he eventually finds himself face to face with the killer. A suspenseful showdown ensues, and Giovanni is able to bring the killer to justice.
