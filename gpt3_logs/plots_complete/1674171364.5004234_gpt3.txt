==========

When the Emperor of China suddenly dies, leaving no heir, the country is plunged into chaos. Civil war breaks out, pitting the various factions against each other in a battle for control of the government.

In the midst of this turmoil, a young woman named Mei-Lin is trying to survive. She ekes out a living as a thief and con artist, using her wits and skills to stay one step ahead of the law.

One day, Mei-Lin's luck runs out. She's caught in the act of stealing from a wealthy merchant, and is sentenced to death.

 Mei-Lin is sent to the imperial palace to be executed. But instead of being killed, she's chosen to be the new Emperor's concubine.

Mei-Lin knows that she's in danger. She's a commoner, and the other concubines are all from noble families. If they find out she's a thief, they'll kill her.

So Mei-Lin keeps her head down and tries to stay out of trouble. But when one of the other concubines is murdered, she realizes that she's in way over her head.

The murderer is someone close to the Emperor, and Mei-Lin is the only one who can stop them. But if she's caught, she'll be killed for sure.

Can Mei-Lin solve the mystery and save herself before it's too late?
