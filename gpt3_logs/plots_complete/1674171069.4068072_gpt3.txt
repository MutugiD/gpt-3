==========

In the early 1960s, India is a country on the verge of change. The conservative values of the past are giving way to a more modern, liberal way of life. But there is a dark underside to this new India, one that is full of poverty, crime, and violence. In the midst of this chaos is a young woman named Maya.

Maya is a bright and beautiful young woman who has just moved to Delhi from her small hometown. She is full of hope and eager to start her new life. But she quickly realizes that the city is not as welcoming as she thought it would be. Everywhere she turns, she is faced with corruption, violence, and poverty.

One day, Maya is walking home from work when she is attacked by a group of men. They drag her into an alleyway and begin to beat and rape her. But just as they are about to finish the job, they are suddenly killed by an unknown assailant.

Maya is traumatized by the attack and decides to leave the city. She moves back to her hometown, but she is followed by the killer. He begins to stalk her, appearing in her dreams and haunting her waking hours. She is terrified, but she does not know who he is or why he is doing this to her.

The killer is revealed to be a man named Rajesh. He was once a member of a religious cult that believed in human sacrifice. The cult was disbanded, but Rajesh continued to practice their dark arts. He now believes that Maya is an incarnation of the goddess they once sacrificed to, and he wants to finish the job.

Maya is running out of time. She must find a way to stop Rajesh before he kills her. But she is also running out of places to hide. With nowhere else to turn, she must face her fears and confront the killer.

The film culminates in a heart-stopping showdown between Maya and Rajesh. She is able to finally stop him, but at what cost? The film ends with Maya traumatized but alive, her psyche forever scarred by the ordeal.
