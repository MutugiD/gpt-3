In the1920s, Italy is a hotbed of crime and corruption. The city of Rome is especially dangerous, with its gangs and Mafia controlling the streets.

She quickly falls in with a gang of criminals, and starts working for the Mafia. She quickly rises through the ranks, thanks to her smarts and her willingness to do whatever it takes to get ahead.

But as Sofia gets sucked deeper and deeper into the criminal underworld, she starts to question whether this is the life she really wants. She starts to yearn for a life of excitement and adventure, and she starts to feel trapped by the Mafia. Her boss, sensing her restlessness, assigns her to a new job: to help transport a shipment of drugs into the city.

Sofia knows that this is a risky job, but she's up for the challenge. She successfully completes the job, but she's caught by the police in the process. She's sentenced to prison, and she's left to wonder whether she made the right decision in joining the Mafia.
